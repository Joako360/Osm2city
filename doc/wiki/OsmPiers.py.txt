[[File:Wick harbour created using osm2city and osm2piers.png|thumb|Wick scenery benefits greatly using generated harbours.]]

Populates a FlightGear scenery offline with piers and boats based on OpenStreetMap data. 

This script is a part of [[Osm2city.py]], reuses some of its infrastructure and therefore the repository, installation and workflow are basically the same and will therefore not be described here.

== Features ==
* Reads nodes and lines related to OSM piers (man_made=pier). {{done}}
* Creates static ships/boats along the pier. {{done}}
* Parameters to control placing of ships {{not done}}

All placement of objects and generation of on-the-fly objects like ships is based on OSM data, topology in OSM as well as heuristics.

== Parameters ==
Currently only the main parameters are used.
