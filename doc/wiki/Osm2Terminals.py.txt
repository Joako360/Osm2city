== Problem ==

Compared to fgfs, in X-Plane/FSX, almost all airports have some buildings and a tower, but mostly they are universal buildings: ie they all look the same, because they are made of generic "bricks". 

The other day I was looking through the shared objects database in FG and found a plethora of hangars, some towers, but no universal ie generic-looking terminal buildings [... ] but if there would be some universal terminal-building it would be much easier to "populate" a large amount of airports. After all, a universal terminal is better than no terminal at all, specially since most ppl dont know what the real thing looks like <ref>{{cite web

How about using generated OSM Buildings for all airports that dont have static models yet ?<ref>{{cite web

Perhaps we could use OSM to create terminal buildings procedurally.<ref>{{cite web

This idea (not specific to OSM though) has been previously discussed on the devel list, and even a prototype has been implemented before (6 years ago), see:<ref>{{cite web

== Motivation ==
it's actually incredibly easy to do using OSM - you'd just need to collect the shapefiles of airport terminals and apply a generic texture to the shapefile-to-building generator. It won't look great, but considering how few terminals we actually have around the world, I think this would at the very least be a start - and I could make all of the buildings available for people to edit and improve. OSM licensing would be the only issue.<ref>{{cite web
