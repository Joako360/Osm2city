Welcome to osm2city's documentation!
====================================
While the article on FlightGear's Wiki_ presents in general terms what ``osm2city`` is and what features it has, this manual goes into depth with many aspects of generating scenery objects based on OpenStreetMap_ (OSM) data and deploying/using them in FlightGear_.

Before you generate your own sceneries, you might want to get familiar with the output of ``osm2city`` by first deploying some of the downloadable osm2city sceneries and have a look at chapter :ref:`Using Generated Scenery <chapter-using-label>`. See amongst others `Areas populated with osm2city scenery <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Areas_populated_with_osm2city_scenery>`_ or look for announcements in the Sceneries_ part of the FlightGear Forums.
