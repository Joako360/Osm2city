Welcome to osm2city's documentation!
====================================
While the article on Flightgear's Wiki_ presents in general terms what ``osm2city`` is and what features it has, this manual goes into depth with many aspects of generating scenery objects based on OpenStreetMap_ (OSM) data and deploying/using them in FlightGear_.

Before you generate your own sceneries, you might want to get familiar with the output of ``osm2city`` by first deploying some of the downloadable already generated sceneries and have a look at chapter :ref:`Deploy and Use Generated Scenery Objects <chapter-deploy-label>`. The following list is not exhaustive and more sceneries are typically announced in the Sceneries_ part of the FlightGear Forums:

* `Areas populated with osm2city scenery <http://wiki.flightgear.org/Areas_populated_with_osm2city_scenery>`_
* `LOWI city buildings <http://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=19625>`_
* `EDDC city models <http://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=18851#p174940>`_
* `OMDB & OMDW <http://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=28218>`_
