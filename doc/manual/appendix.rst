====================
OSM Data in Database
====================

The following chapters are dedicated to give some information and pointers to keeping OSM data in a database instead of files for processing in osm2city. This is not a complete guide and will concentrate on only one possible scenario: `PostGIS <http://www.postgis.net/>`_ on Ubuntu Linux.

Some overall pointers:

* PostGIS on OSM wiki: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/PostGIS
* Book PostGIS in Action, especially chapter 4.4 of the 2nd edition: http://www.postgis.us/
* PostgreSQL on Ubuntu: https://help.ubuntu.com/community/PostgreSQL
* Volker Schatz's online manual of OSM tools: http://www.volkerschatz.com/net/osm/osmman.html
* HStore information in PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/devel/static/hstore.html
* HStore and minutely OSM planet dump info in German: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/DE:HowTo_minutely_hstore


------------------
Installed Packages
------------------

On Ubuntu 16.04 the following packages have amongst others been installed (not exhausting list):

* postgresql-9.5
* postgresql-client-9.5
* postgresql-contrib-9.5
* pgadmin3
* postgis
* python-psycopg2

On top of that you also need a 0.6+ version of Osmosis_. Please be aware of the fact that you also need a related version of Java and that e.g. in Ubuntu 16.04 Osmosis is out of date.


--------------------------
Assumptions / Requirements
--------------------------

* The following examples of usage will assume that the database name is ``osmgis`` and the user is ``gisuser``. Of course your installation can differ and you can set different parameters fo≈ï :ref:`Database <chapter-parameters-database>`.
* See :ref:`Getting OpenStreetMap Data <chapter-getting-data-label>`. To get data for the whole planet go to Planet OSM (http://planet.osm.org/).
* Setting up a PostGIS database as described in `PostGIS setup`_ (replace ``pgsnapshot`` with whatever you named the database, e.g. ``osmogis``). For now schema support for linestrings does not have to be set up. However you need to run ``pgsimple_schema_0.6_bbox.sql``.


You might want to index the tags in hstore to get some more query speed after loading the data:

::

    CREATE INDEX idx_nodes_tags ON nodes USING gist(tags);
    CREATE INDEX idx_ways_tags ON ways USING gist(tags);
    CREATE INDEX idx_relations_tags ON relations USING gist(tags);

.. _PostGIS setup: http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Osmosis/PostGIS_Setup


--------------------------------
Importing Data into the Database
--------------------------------

The following is an example of executing the import of an xml-file with OSM data in a setup, where connections with the local user are trusted in PostgreSQL. See also `PostGIS Tasks (Snapshot Schema)`_:

::

    /home/pingu/bin/osmosis-latest/bin/osmosis --read-xml /media/sf_fg_customscenery/projects/LSMP/lsmp.osm --log-progress --write-pgsql database=osmogis

I have not found out how to add an additional region to an already populated database. Therefore you might need to run ``/home/pingu/bin/osmosis-latest/bin/osmosis --truncate-pgsql database=osmogis`` before getting a new region into the database.
