This is the tex.src/ folder of osm2city.py

It is not stored on gitorious because its binary content will change
every now and then. Get it from here:
http://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=22809
I will update the links there for every new version.

These textures will go into osm2city's texture atlas.
No need to distribute tex.src/ to your users.
