This is the texture folder of osm2city.py
Models generated by osm2city will use these textures.

It is not stored on gitorious because its binary content will change
every now and then. Get it from here:
http://forum.flightgear.org/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=22809
I will update the links there for every new version.

When you run osm2city, it will
- read textures in tex.src/
- generate a texture atlas "atlas_facades.png" and its light-map
- and store it in here.

Distribute your tex/ folder along with your scenery.
